## Motivation

Daily standups haven't worked much where I'm at. Typically tends to be a long status report which isn't a good thing. Other times, we can't get into a decent tech discusion because it is is outside the scope.
Things also get lost. Chatroom based "standups" have worked ok, in that they don't produce interuptions (when you're in the flow, the last thing you want to do is stop for a standup). Also, people have different schedules and whatnot.
When appropriate each memebr can check up on status and discuss anything necessary. Chatrooms, though, aren't that good at keeping a thread going.

The aim of this app is to enable the async daily standup, with threaded discussion, hooks to systems (linke build, deployment, and other event generators)
and add some other elements that can simplify team discussion and colaboration

Also, being somewhat proof of concept, and usefull, it'll serve also as a playground (unless it matures enough) for tech and framework experimentation.
